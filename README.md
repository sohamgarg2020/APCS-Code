# APCS-Code
This repository will be a place where I will be storing all the projects I do in AP Computer Science A in the year 2021-2022.

Whenever you want to apply the edits, make sure to do `javac <insert file name>` and then do `java <insert file name without .java>`. For example if I made edits to `Main.java`, I would run the two following commands: 
```java
sohamgarg2020:~$ javac Main.java
sohamgarg2020:~$ java Main
```
